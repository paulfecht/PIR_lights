 * How to use a PIR sensor with the Arduino
http://www.electronicslovers.com/2015/08/how-to-use-pir-sensor-with-arduino.html
 * The sensor's output pin goes to HIGH if motion is present.
 * However, even if motion is present it goes to LOW from time to time, 
 * which might give the impression no motion is present. 
 * This program deals with this issue by ignoring LOW-phases shorter than a given time, 
 * assuming continuous motion is present during these phases.
